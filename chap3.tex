\chapter{Properties defined by convergence} 

In this chapter we will use the following convention: when we say a uniformly sequential space $(X,\sim)$ has a property defined for a sequential space we mean that $\Xi_\sim$ has this property.

\section{Continuous and uniformly continuous mappings}

\begin{define}\label{def:cont}
Let $\Xi_X$ and $\Xi_Y$ be two \fcss\ on sets $X$ and $Y$. We say $f:X\to Y$ is a \emph{continuous mapping $\Xi_X$ to $\Xi_Y$} if $(\{x_n\},x)\in\Xi_X$ implies that $\left(\{f(x_n)\},f(x)\right)\in\Xi_Y$.
\end{define}

%To distinguish among Definitions \ref{def:contf} and \ref{def:cont} of a continuous mapping we will sometimes write $f:(X,\varrho)\to (Y, \sigma)$, $f:\Xi_X\to \Xi_Y$. The following theorem states that, in fact, both definitions are the same.
The following theorem is often covered in basic course of mathematical analysis. We include it for completeness.

\begin{theorem} \label{th:contpr}
Let $\Xi_X$ and $\Xi_Y$ be two \fcss\ generated by metric spaces $(X,\varrho)$ and $(Y,\sigma)$. Let $f:X\to Y$ be a mapping. Then the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item $f:(X,\varrho)\to (Y, \sigma)$ is continuous;
	\item $f:\Xi_X\to \Xi_Y$ is continuous.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem} 
\begin{proof}
Let $x\in X$ be a fixed point.

Let condition \emph{(i)} hold and $x_n\to x$ (that is, $(\{x_n\},x)\in\Xi_X$). For $\varepsilon>0$ we find $\delta>0$ from Definition  \ref{def:contf}. Then there exists $n_\varepsilon$ such that for $\forall n\ge n_\varepsilon$ we have $\varrho(x_n, x)<\delta$ and then $\sigma(f(x_n), f(x))<\varepsilon$. Hence $f(x_n)\to f(x)$ in $Y$, that is, $(\{f(x_n)\},f(x))\in\Xi_Y$.

Let now condition \emph{(ii)} hold and for contradiction suppose that \emph{(i)} does not. Then
\[
	\exists \varepsilon>0\ \forall\delta>0\ \forall y\in X: \varrho(x,y)<\delta \Rightarrow \sigma(f(x), f(y))\ge\varepsilon.
\]
We fix this $\varepsilon$ and find a sequence $\{x_n\}$ such that $\varrho(x_1,x)<1$ and $\varrho(x_{n+1},x)<min(\frac{1}{n},\varrho(x_n,x))$ for $n\in \mathbb{N}$. Then $x_n\to x$ hence from \emph{(ii)} $f(x_n)\to f(x)$. This is not possible since 
$\sigma(f(x_n), f(x))\ge\varepsilon$ for $n\in \mathbb{N}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{define}\label{def:uncont}
Let $(X,\sim_X)$ and $(Y,\sim_Y)$ be two uniformly sequential spaces. We say $f:X\to Y$ is a \emph{uniformly continuous mapping $\sim_X$ to $\sim_Y$} if $\{x_n\}\sim_X\{y_n\}$ implies that $\{f(x_n)\}\sim_Y\{f(y_n)\}$.
\end{define}

\begin{theorem} \label{th:contpr}
Let $\sim_X$ and $\sim_Y$ be two \uss{}s\ generated by metric spaces $(X,\varrho)$ and $(Y,\sigma)$. Let $f:X\to Y$ be a mapping. Then the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item $f:(X,\varrho)\to (Y, \sigma)$ is uniformly continuous;
	\item $f:(X,\sim_X)\to (Y,\sim_Y)$ is uniformly continuous.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem} 
\begin{proof}
Let \emph{(i)} hold and $\{x_n\}\sim_X\{y_n\}$. Since $\lim_{n\to\infty}\varrho(x_n,y_n)=0$ we have
\[
	\forall \delta>0\ \exists n_0\in\mathbb{N}\ \forall n\in\mathbb{N}, n\ge n_0: \varrho(x_n.y_n)<\delta.
\]
Let $\varepsilon>0$. We find $\delta$ from the definition of \emph{(i)}, then we find $n_0$ from the previous formula. We obtain
\[
	\forall n\in\mathbb{N}, n\ge n_0: \sigma(f(x_n),f(y_n))<\varepsilon,
\]
so $\lim_{n\to\infty}\sigma(f(x_n),f(y_n))=0$.

Let \emph{(i)} does not hold. Than there exists $\varepsilon>0$ such that for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$ we can find $x_n,y_n\in X$, $\varrho(x_n,y_n)<\frac{1}{n}$ and $\sigma(f(x_n),f(y_n))>\varepsilon$. That is, $\{x_n\}\sim_X\{y_n\}$ but $\{f(x_n)\}\not\sim_Y\{f(y_n)\}$.
\end{proof}

\section{Open and closed sets in sequential spaces and related topological properties}

If we were able to define a topology on $\Xi$ we would obtain many interesting properties. In this section we will try to achieve this.

With knowledge of the form of closed sets obtained from Theorem \ref{th:mpseq}\emph{(vi)} it seems natural to define a closure using similar approach and then use Theorem \ref{th:ico}.

\begin{define}\label{def:po}
Let $\Xi$ be a \fcs\ on $X$, $A\subset X$ and $x\in X$ then we say $x\in c(A)$ if $\exists\ (\{x_n\}, x)\in\Xi: \{x_n\}\subset A$. That is, a point lies in the closure of a set if there is a sequence in the set converging to the point.
\end{define}

However operator $c$ defined above is not a closure operator. It is easy to show that conditions \emph{(i)}-\emph{(iii)} in Theorem \ref{th:pco} hold, but generally \emph{(iv)} does not. In the following example we will show a space in which \emph{(iv)} does not hold. Please note that when $\Xi$ is generated by a metric space $c$ is a closure operator.

\begin{example}
	Let $X=\{f, f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}\}$ be a space of all real functions on real numbers, $\{f_n\}\subset X$ a sequence of functions and $f\in X$ a function. We say $(\{f_n\}, f)\in\Xi$ if
\[
	\forall\ x\in \mathbb{R}: \lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(x)=f(x).
\]
Such convergence is usually called pointwise convergence.

Clearly $(\{f\},f)\in\Xi$. When $\{f_{n_k}\}\subset X$ is a subsequence of $\{f_n\}$ then for any $x\in \mathbb{R}$ $\{f_{n_k}(x)\}$ is a subsequence of $\{f_n(x)\}$. As these are sequences of real numbers we have $\lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(x)=\lim_{k\to\infty}f_{n_k}(x)$ and $(\{f_{n_k}\}, f)\in\Xi$. If $(\{f_n\}, f)\notin\Xi$ then there is $x_0\in \mathbb{R}$ for which $\lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(x_0)\ne f(x_0)$. And again since those are real sequences we easily obtain the remaining conditions and therefore $\Xi$ is a \fcs\ on $X$.

Now let $C$ be a set of all real continuous functions of real variable. Then $C\subset X$. Applying operator $c$ from Definition \ref{def:po} we have that $c(C)$ are continuous functions and functions of Baire class 1. Accordingly $c(c(C))$ are continuous functions, functions of Baire class 1 and functions of Baire class 2. It is known that Baire class 2 set in non-empty and therefore $c(C)\ne c(c(C))$.
\end{example}

Operator that satisfies all conditions but \emph{(iv)} is sometimes called a \emph{ÄŒech closure operator}. 

\begin{define}\label{def:io}
Let $\Xi$ be a \fcs\ on $X$, $A\subset X$ and $x\in X$ then we say $x\in \mathrm{Int} A$ if $\forall\ (\{x_n\}, x)\in\Xi\ \exists \{x_{n_k}\}$ subsequence of $\{x_n\}: \{x_{n_k}\}\subset A$. Set $A$ is \emph{open in $(X,\Xi)$} if $A=\mathrm{Int} A$. That is, a set is open when all sequences converging to a point in the set eventually lie in the set.

A set $A\subset X$ is \emph{closed in $(X,\Xi)$} if $X\setminus A$ is open in $(X,\Xi)$.
\end{define}

To show that our first guess in Definition \ref{def:po} can lead to a topology owe introduce the next theorem, which we state without proof.

\begin{theorem} \label{th:topxi}
Operator $c_{\omega_1}$ defined by a transfinite induction
\[
	c_\alpha(A):=c\left(\bigcup_{\beta<\alpha} c_\beta(A)\right),
\]
where $\alpha$ is an ordinal number, $A\subset X$ and $c$ is operator from Definition \ref{def:po}, is a Kuratowski closure operator. That is, it meets the condition \emph{(iv)} in Theorem \ref{th:pco}:  $c(c_{\omega_1}(A))=c_{\omega_1}(A)$. Moreover $c_{\omega_1}$ generates the same closed sets (and therefore the same topology) as in Definition \ref{th:topxi}.
\end{theorem}

\section{Complete and totally bounded spaces}

\begin{define}\label{def:scompl}
	Let $X$ have a \uss. We say $X$ is \emph{complete} if for every Cauchy sequence $\{x_n\}$ in $X$ we have $(\{x_n\}, x)\in\Xi_\sim$ for some $x\in X$.
\end{define}

Completeness is very closely related to Cauchyness of sequences. That is why we need to define it using uniformly sequential spaces. The definition follows the definition of complete metric space. The next theorem therefore seems natural.

\begin{theorem} \label{th:scomplcompl}
	Let $(X,\sim_\varrho)$ be a uniformly sequential space generated by metric space $(X,\varrho)$. Then $(X,\varrho)$ is complete if and only if $(X,\sim_\varrho)$ is complete.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
It is sufficient to show that a sequence $\{x_n\}$ is Cauchy in $(X,\varrho)$ if and only if it is Cauchy in $(X,\sim)$.

Let $\varepsilon>0$, let $\{x_n\}$ be a Cauchy sequence in $(X,\varrho)$ and $\{x_{n_k}\}$ be its subsequence. Because $\{x_n\}$ is Cauchy we find $m_0$ from Definition \ref{def:seqprp}. That is, for every $n,m\in \mathbb{N},\ n,m\ge m_0$ we have $\varrho(x_n,x_m)<\varepsilon$. Specially $\lim_{k\to\infty}\varrho(x_k, x_{n_k})=0$.

Let us suppose that there exists $\{x_{n_k}\}$ such that $\{x_n\}\not\sim_\varrho\{x_{n_k}\}$. That is,
\[
	\exists\varepsilon>0\ \forall k_0\in \mathbb{N}\ \exists k\in \mathbb{N}, k\ge k_0: \varrho(x_k, x_{n_k})\ge \varepsilon.
\]
Then if we choose $n=n_k, m=k$ in the definition of Cauchy sequence in metric space we see that $\{x_n\}$ is not Cauchy.
\end{proof}

\begin{define}\label{def:stb}
	Let $X$ have a \uss. We say $X$ is \emph{totally bounded} if for every sequence $\{x_n\}$ in $X$ there exists a subsequence $\{x_{n_k}\}$ which is Cauchy.
\end{define}

It is uncommon to characterise totally bounded metric spaces using this or similar condition. It is however equivalent as the next shows us.

\begin{theorem} \label{th:stbtb}
	Let $(X,\sim_\varrho)$ be a uniformly sequential space generated by a metric space $(X,\varrho)$. Then $(X,\varrho)$ is totally bounded if and only if $(X,\sim_\varrho)$ is totally bounded.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $(X,\varrho)$ be totally bounded and $\{x_{0,n}\}$ be a sequence in $X$. Then for every $m\in \mathbb{N}$ there exists a finite family of open balls $B_1, \dots, B_M$ with radius $\frac{1}{m}$ such that $X=\bigcup_{i=1}^MB_i$. Since a sequence is infinite there exists a ball which contains an infinite number of members of sequence $\{x_{m-1,n}\}$. We choose one such ball and denote $\{x_{m,n}\}$ a subsequence of $\{x_{m-1,n}\}$ which consists of points in the ball only. Then $\{x_{n,n}\}$ is Cauchy because for every $m\in \mathbb{N},\ n>m$ we have $\varrho(x_{n,n},x_{m,m})<\frac{2}{m}$.

To prove the sufficiency let us suppose that $(X,\varrho)$ is not totally bounded. That is, there exists $\varepsilon>0$ for which no finite family of open balls with diameter $\varepsilon$ covers whole $X$. We select an arbitrary point $x_1\in X$. Then for $n\in \mathbb{N}$ we find $x_{n+1}\in X\setminus\bigcup_{i=1}^n B(x_i, \varepsilon)\ne\emptyset$. Then any subsequence of $\{x_n\}$ is not Cauchy because for every $n, m\in \mathbb{N},\ n\ne m$ we have $\varrho(x_n,x_m)\ge\varepsilon$, so $(X,\sim)$ is not totally bounded.
\end{proof}

\section{Compact spaces}

Characterisation of compactness in metric space in term of convergence is widely known. We use this principle to define compact sequential space.

\begin{define}\label{def:cmp}
We say a sequential space \emph{$(X,\Xi)$ is compact} if for any arbitrary sequence $\{x_n\}\subset X$ there exists a subsequence $\{x_{n_k}\}$ and a point $x\in X$ such that $(\{x_{n_k}\}, x)\in\Xi$.
\end{define}

Direct proof of equivalence is covered in basic courses. We present a proof which follows from previously showed relation between total boundedness and completeness in metric and uniformly sequential spaces. The following theorem together with Theorems \ref{th:cmpcmpltb}, \ref{th:scomplcompl} and \ref{th:stbtb} give us the equivalence indirectly.

\begin{theorem} \label{th:comptbcompl}
A uniformly sequential space $(X,\sim)$ is compact if and only if it is totally bounded and complete.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $(X,\sim)$ be totally bounded and complete. Let $\{x_n\}$ be an arbitrary sequence in $X$. Because $(X,\sim)$ is totally bounded we can find a subsequence $\{x_{n_k}\}$ which is Cauchy. Because $(X,\sim)$ is complete we can find a point $x\in X$ such that $(\{x_{n_k}\}, x)\in\Xi_\sim$.

Let $(X,\sim)$ be compact. From Theorem \ref{th:cauchconvg} we have that is is  totally bounded. Let $\{x_n\}$ be a Cauchy sequence, we can find a subsequence $\{x_{n_k}\}$ and a point $x\in X$ such that $(\{x_{n_k}\}, x)\in\Xi_\sim$. That is, $\{x_{n_k}\}\sim\{x\}$ and since $\{x_n\}$ is Cauchy we have $\{x_n\}\sim\{x_{n_k}\}$, from transitivity of $\sim$ we obtain $\{x_n\}\sim\{x\}$. So $(\{x_n\}, x)\in\Xi_\sim$ and $(X,\sim)$ is complete.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary} \label{cr:compseqsomp}
Let $(X,\varrho)$ be a metric space and $\Xi$ is generated by $(X,\varrho)$. Then $(X,\varrho)$ is compact if and only if $(X,\Xi)$ is compact.
\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem} \label{th:contucont}
Let $(X,\sim_X), (Y,\sim_Y)$ be two uniformly sequential spaces, $f:X\to Y$ be a continuous mapping and $(X,\sim_X)$ be compact. Then $f$ is uniformly continuous.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $\{x_n\} \sim_X\{y_n\}$ and let us for contradiction suppose that $\{f(x_n)\} \not\sim_Y\{f(y_n)\}$. Then from \emph{(U3)} we find subsequences $\{f(x_{n_k})\}$ and $\{f(y_{n_k})\}$ such that for none their subsequences we have $\{f(x_{n_{k_i}})\} \sim_Y\{f(y_{n_{k_i}})\}$. Because $X$ is compact we can find subsequences $\{x_{n_{k_i}}\}$ of $\{x_{n_k}\}$, $\{y_{n_{k_i}}\}$ of $\{y_{n_k}\}$ and points $x,y\in X$ such that $(\{x_{n_{k_i}}\},x)\in\Xi_{\sim_X}$ and $(\{y_{n_{k_i}}\},y)\in\Xi_{\sim_X}$. Since $\{x_n\} \sim_X\{y_n\}$ we have $\{x_{n_k}\} \sim_X\{y_{n_k}\}$ and therefore $x=y$. Mapping $f$ is continuous so $(\{f(x_{n_{k_i}})\},f(x))\in\Xi_{\sim_Y}$ and $(\{f(y_{n_{k_i}})\},f(x))\in\Xi_{\sim_Y}$. That is, $\{f(x_{n_{k_i}})\}\sim_Y\{f(x)\}$ and $\{f(y_{n_{k_i}})\}\sim_Y\{f(x)\}$ which gives us $\{f(x_{n_{k_i}})\}\sim_Y\{f(y_{n_{k_i}})\}$ which is the contradiction.
\end{proof}

The following example proves that the implication in the previous theorem can not be reversed.

\begin{example}\label{ex:madn}
We say two infinite sets are \emph{almost disjoint} if their intersection is finite. Let us assume an infinite maximal family of almost disjoint subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ and denote it as $\mathrm{MAD}(\mathbb{N})$.
	
For a reader's image of some infinite family of almost disjoint subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ we will show a construction of one. Let $f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{Q}$ be a bijection of natural numbers onto rational numbers. For every irrational $x\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}$ we will choose one rational sequence $\{r_n\}$ such that $r_n\to x$. Then $\mathcal{S}_x:=f^{-1}[\{r_n\}]\subset \mathbb{N}$ is a preimage of that sequence. Then  $\{\mathcal{S}_x: x\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}\}$ is an infinite family of almost disjoint subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ because if two sets had an infinite intersection the corresponding rational sequences would have an infinite intersection too and since they are both convergent it follows they would converge to the same point.

Please note that using this construction we do not obtain a $\mathrm{MAD}(\mathbb{N})$ as for example the preimage of the set of all even numbers is almost disjoint with all constructed sets.

We denote $\mathrm{MAD}(\mathbb{N})=\{\mathcal{S}_\alpha: \alpha\in A\}$ for some set $A$. Let $X:=\mathbb{N}\cup\mathrm{MAD}(\mathbb{N})$ with the smallest sequential structure such that
\[
	\mathcal{S}_\alpha\to\{\mathcal{S}_\alpha\},\quad \{\mathcal{S}_\alpha\}\in \mathrm{MAD}(\mathbb{N}).
\]
This condition can be rephrased: members of $\mathcal{S}_\alpha$ as points in $\mathbb{N}$ converge to $\mathcal{S}_\alpha$ as point in $\mathrm{MAD}(\mathbb{N})$.
Then every continuous mapping to $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded but the space is evidently not compact.

To prove this let $f:X\to\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous unbounded mapping. That is, there exists a sequence $\{x_n\}$ for which $f(x_n)\to\infty$. Now we examine two cases.

First, infinitely many members of $\{x_n\}$ lie in $\mathbb{N}$, so we can find a subsequence $\{x_{n_k}\}\subset\mathbb{N}$. Then there exists $\mathcal{S}_\alpha\in \mathrm{MAD}(\mathbb{N})$ such that $\{x_{n_k}\}\to\mathcal{S}_\alpha$. Then we have $\{f(x_{n_k})\}\to f(\mathcal{S}_\alpha)$ and $\{f(x_{n_k})\}\to \infty$ which is a contradiction.

Second, only finite number of members of $\{x_n\}$ lie in $\mathbb{N}$. Without loss of generality we suppose that $\{x_n\}=\{\mathcal{S}_{\alpha_n}\}\subset\mathrm{MAD}(\mathbb{N})$. For every $n\in\mathbb{N}$ we can find $y_n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $|f(y_n)-f(\mathcal{S}_{\alpha_n})|\le1$. The first case yields $\{f(y_n)\}$ is bounded and so $\{f(\mathcal{S}_{\alpha_n})\}$ is bounded.
\end{example}


\section{Bounded spaces}

Diameter of a set extremely depends on used metric. At first, it might seem natural that when a set has a finite (infinite) diameter it will have it finite (infinite) in every equivalent metric. The following theorem uses quite known definition of equivalent metrics to prove otherwise.

\begin{theorem} \label{th:unbdtobd}
When $(X,\varrho)$ is an unbounded metric space then there exists a metric $\sigma$ on $X$ that is equivalent with $\varrho$ and $(X,\sigma)$ is bounded.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
For $x,y\in X$ we define
\[
	\sigma_1(x,y):=\frac{\varrho(x,y)}{1+\varrho(x,y)},\qquad\sigma_2(x,y):=\min\{\varrho(x,y), 1\}.
\]
See \cite[p.~22]{copson88} for $\sigma_1$ and \cite[p.~250]{engelking89} for $\sigma_2$ for proofs that they satisfy the conditions for a metric. Then evidently both $\sigma_1, \sigma_2$ are equivalent with $\varrho$ and are bounded.
\end{proof}

The previous theorem not only shows a diameter of a space in an equivalent metric can be finite, it also shows it can be any positive real number $a>0$ we want. We just take $\sigma(x,y):=a\cdot\sigma_i(x,y)$ where $\sigma_i$ is from Theorem \ref{th:unbdtobd} and $i=1$ or $i=2$.

This result is enough to answer the problem. We also show the not-so-known theorem that under some quite unrestrictive conditions a space with finite diameter in some metric can have the infinite diameter in an other equivalent metric. The proof is constructive, that is, we give exact form of such metric.

\begin{theorem} \label{th:bdtounbd}
When $(X,\varrho)$ is a non-compact bounded metric space then there exists a metric $\sigma$ on $X$ that is equivalent with $\varrho$ and $(X,\sigma)$ is unbounded.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Had we constructed a function $f: X\to \mathbb{R}$ continuous and unbouded we would define
\[
	\sigma(x,y):=\varrho(x,y)+|f(x)-f(y)|.
\]

Evidently $\sigma(x,x)=0$. We have $\sigma(x,z) \le \sigma(x,y)+\sigma(z,y)$ because when rewitten it is
\[
	\varrho(x,z)+|f(x)-f(z)| \le \varrho(x,y)+\varrho(z,y)+|f(x)-f(y)|+|f(z)-f(y)|.\nonumber
\]
This holds because $|f(y)-f(z)|=|f(z)-f(y)|$, the triangle inequality holds for $\varrho$ and
\[
	|f(x)-f(z)|=|f(x)-f(y)+f(y)-f(z)|\le |f(x)-f(y)|+|f(y)-f(z)|.
\]

Let $\{x_n\}\subset X$ and $x_n\to x\in X$ in metric $\varrho$. Since $f$ is continuous we know
\[
	\lim_{n\to\infty}|f(x_n)-f(x)|=0
\]
and therefore $x_n\to x$ also in metric $\sigma$.

Let now $\{y_n\}\subset X$ and $y_n\to y\in X$ in metric $\sigma$. Then from
\[
	0\le\lim_{n\to\infty} \varrho(y_n,y)\le\lim_{n\to\infty} \left(\varrho(y_n,y) + |f(y_n)-f(y)|\right)=\lim_{n\to\infty} \sigma(y_n,y)=0
\]
follows  $y_n\to y$ also in metric $\varrho$. That is, $\sigma$ and $\varrho$ are equivalent and $(X,\sigma)$ is unbounded.

When a metric space is non-compact it means there exists a sequence for which no subsequence converges, let $\{x_n\}$ be such sequence. Then $\{x_n\}$ is closed in $X$. Without loss of generality we suppose that $x_n\ne x_m$ if $n\ne m$. 

Then for every $n\in \mathbb{N}$ there exists $a_n>0$ such that $\forall m\in\mathbb{N}, n\ne m: \varrho(x_n,x_m)\ge 3a_n$. 
We define a function $f: X\to \mathbb{R}$:
\[
	f(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}n\cdot\varrho(x, X\setminus B(x_n, a_n)), & \mathrm{if}\ x\in B(x_n, a_n)\ \mathrm{for\ some}\ n\in\mathbb{N}; \\ 0, & \mathrm{othervise}. \end{array} \right.
\]
We can easily see that $f$ is continuous and unbounded.
\end{proof}

The previous theorems show that we (generally) can not distinguish between $\Xi$ generated by a bounded and an unbounded metric on the same set. Because of this we do not define any kind of boundedness of sequential spaces.

As a side product we obtain another interesting characterisation of compactness in metric spaces.

\begin{corollary} \label{cr:bdcomp}
A metric space $(X,\varrho)$ is bounded in every equivalent metric if and only if it is compact.
\end{corollary}

\section{Connected spaces}

Since we introduced topology on sequential spaces we could delegate the problem of characterisation of connectedness to it. It is however useful to define connected spaces with continuous mapping.

In the following we take $D=\{0,1\}$ with $(\Xi_D)_0$, that is, a two-point space with discrete (in meaning of Theorem \ref{th:genxi0}) sequential structure.

\begin{define}\label{def:conn}
A sequential space $(X,\Xi)$ is \emph{connected} if every continuous mapping $f:X\to D$ is constant, that is, $f[X]\subset\{0\}$ or $f[X]\subset\{1\}$.
\end{define}

\begin{theorem} \label{th:conneq}
Let $(X,\varrho)$ be a metric space and $\Xi$ be generated by $(X,\varrho)$. Then $(X,\varrho)$ is connected if and only if $(X,\Xi)$ is connected.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $(X,\Xi)$ be connected. For contradiction let us suppose $U,V$ are subsets of $X$, both open non-empty, $X=U\cup V$ and $U\cap V=\emptyset$. We define $f:X\to D$ as follows
\[
	f(x):= \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}1, & \mathrm{if}\ x\in U; \\ 0, & \mathrm{if}\ x\in V. \end{array} \right.
\]
Then $f$ is continuous and $f[X]=D$. That is a contradiction with $(X,\Xi)$ being connected.

Let now $(X,\varrho)$ be connected. For contradiction let us suppose $f:X\to D$ is a continuous mapping such that $f[X]=D$. Then preimages of one-point (open) sets $U:=f^{-1}[\{0\}]$, $V:=f^{-1}[\{1\}]$ are open in $(X,\varrho)$. Moreover $X=U\cup V$, $U\cap V=\emptyset$ and $U,V$ are non-empty because $\{0,1\}\subset f[X]$. Which is a contradiction with $(X,\varrho)$ being connected.
\end{proof}
\section{Separable spaces}

Again we have a topology so we could use the closure operator and define separability analogically with Definition \ref{def:allprp}. In metric spaces we obtain an equivalent characterisation as it is showed afterwards.

\begin{define}\label{def:sep}
Let $\Xi$ be a \fcs\ on set $X$. We say $\Xi$ is \emph{separable} if there exists a countable subset $A\subset X$ such that
\[
	\forall x\in X\ \exists\{x_n\}\subset A: (\{x_n\},x)\in \Xi.
\]
\end{define}

\begin{corollary} \label{th:conneq}
Let $(X,\varrho)$ be a metric space and $\Xi$ be generated by $(X,\varrho)$. Then $(X,\varrho)$ is separable if and only if $\Xi$ is separable.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
We use Theorem \ref{th:mpseq}\emph{(vi)}.
\end{proof}

It is known that a compact metric space is always separable. The following example shows that this implication does not hold for sequential spaces.

\begin{example}\label{ex:madnw1}
Let $X:=\bigcup_{\beta<\omega_1}X_{\beta}$ where $X_\beta$ are defined by a transfinite induction:
\[
	X_1:=\mathbb{N}, \qquad
	X_\alpha:=\mathrm{MAD}(X_{\alpha-1}), \quad
	X_\gamma:=\mathrm{MAD}(\mathcal{K_\gamma}), \quad
	%X_\alpha:=\mathrm{MAD}(\bigcup_{\beta<\alpha}X_{\beta}),
\]
where $\alpha$ is a successor ordinal, $\gamma$ is a limit ordinal and $\mathcal{K_\gamma}$ denotes the family of sequences that have a finite intersection with $X_\beta$ for every $\beta<\gamma$. We say $X_\beta$ is a \emph{level} for every $\beta$. On $X$ we take a \fcs\ defined analogically to Example \ref{ex:madn}.

Then $X$ is compact. Really, let $\{x_n\}$ be a sequence in $X$. It follows that either $\{x_n\}$ contains an infinite number of members in some level or it has a finite intersection with every level. In the first case we can easily find a convergent subsequence. In the second case, since $\{x_n\}$ has countably many members there exists an $\alpha_0<\omega_1$ such that $\{x_n\}\subset\bigcup_{\beta<\alpha_0}X_\beta$ so it also has a convergent subsequence.

Let $A\subset X$ be a countable set. Then again there exists an $\alpha_0<\omega_1$ such that $A\subset\bigcup_{\beta<\alpha_0}X_\beta$. For every $x\in X_{\alpha_0+1}$ no subsequence $\{x_n\}\subset A$ converges to $x$. That is, $X$ is not separable.
